# Jukebox for my kids

I made it to run on raspberry pi with a 3.5" touchscreen. It uses the pygame module.

What works now:
- You can press a sprite (an icon) and the music starts. Also, the sprite will start to move ("dance").
- Page up and page down button

Future
- 6 songe per page
- When on last page, jump to first page when pressing down
- Right now pages are very rigid. Will improve on that firstly.
